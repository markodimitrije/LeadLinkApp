 * Protocol for location selection. Location selections implement a specific strategy how a data object (like a barcode) is chosen out of multiple visible ones. See Scan Area Guide for an in-depth explanation of location selection.
 *
 * Location selection implementations are restricted to the set of location selections provided by the Scandit Data Capture SDK, it is not possible for customers to conform to this protocol and provide custom location selection implementations. This protocol does not expose any methods or properties, it just serves as a tag for different selection strategies.
